A brief picture of the diffusion of the working from home maodality after the pandemic in EU countries.

A clear huge revolution in the work organisation, which can not be dismissed as a temporary measure to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic.

A simple measure give count of the phenomenon. The average percent of workers (employees) that usually work from home in the following three years: `r M2019`%, `r M2020`%, `r M2021`%.

Moreover, as we can appreciate, the dynamic of the percentage of employees working from home (PercWFH) was rather flat in the past 30 years.

Since the number of employees in EU countries is around 155 millions, the positive delta percent of 10 po
ints registered from 2019 to 2021 in usually working from home  represent 15 millions employees.
